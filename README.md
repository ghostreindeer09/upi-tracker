## 🌍 Vision

The goal is for UPI Transaction Tracker to evolve into more than just a web application. In the future, it could take the form of a browser extension (or system-level automation tool) that:

🔄 Automatically syncs UPI transactions, removing the need for manual entry.

📤 Exports transaction logs to GitHub repositories, ideal for:

Financial journaling

Expense automation

Version-controlled backups

⚙️ Works like popular LeetCode-to-GitHub extensions, which push updates automatically in the background.

💡 Think of it as the "LeetCode GitHub sync" equivalent — but for your digital financial life.
